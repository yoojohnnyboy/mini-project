# mini-project

Hi everyone, here is the code so you could use for your discord. I know this had been probably made but I wanted to try to learn and understand how they are able to implement the code for it showed. IM SO EXCITEDDD!!!!

FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

First: Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and sign in, if you haven't 

Second: Make a new application 

Third: Go to OAuth2, where you will find your client_id 

Fourth: Go to Rich Presence Art Assets will you could add images, make sure the image is 1024x1024 or 512x512. Also, when adding the image make sure you name the file. For example, if you save a image and google and you see this dcce1e651be4f557dc3eb2b68ed19da9 then change it to blahblah and that's it.

Here is the website for a image converter that converts images to 1024x1024, 512x512, and more:

Website: https://anytools.pro/en/img/editor/resize1024

By the I recommened, if your using a IDE (Integreated Development Enviroment) go to your terminal and type these command " pip install pypresence " then when install run the program. 

Anyways, that's all enjoy the code.
